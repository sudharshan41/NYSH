## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F2F5), a softer, desaturated shade of the primary color, will keep the focus on the content.
- Accent color: Bright orange (#FF9800), an analogous color used to highlight key interactive elements.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', a modern, readable sans-serif font for body text; headline: 'Playfair', a modern serif, with an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel, is chosen for headlines. 
- Use clean, modern icons from a consistent set to represent different sections and actions, ensuring they are easily recognizable.
- Implement a responsive, grid-based layout to ensure the website looks good on all devices, maintaining a clean and organized structure.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations on page load and when hovering over interactive elements to enhance user engagement.
